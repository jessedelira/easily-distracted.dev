## intro (don't spare the details)

Some of my favorite developer content on YouTube is developer tools and config breakdowns, these videos have shown me plenty of amazing tools that I would have never found otherwise. There are always new tools coming out so it is nice to see these summarized so nicely, on the other hand I have noticed a lack of depth on what the tools are used for by each person (everyone uses them differently). 

A majority of the time I'm left asking myself questions about the situations they use them (who, what, where, why, when)

Example:

- I use VS Code for my coding projects
- Questions
  - Is your development stack Java + React? If so is the Java Language Server extension have equal parity with IntelliJ?
  - What extensions do you use and in what situations do you use them?
  - Your editor looks fantastic because things are not default, share your `settings.json` file (VS Code)

## tools & configs
