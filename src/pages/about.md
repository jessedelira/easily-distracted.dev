I'm Jesse De Lira, a software engineer based in Chicago, IL. I enjoy watching the Indianapolis Colts, tinker on projects, playing milsim games (Arma), and spending time with my partner and our toy poodle named Obi.

## Tech Stack

I primarily use TypeScript for my projects (I have used a variety of runtimes haha, mostly Node.js). Whether that is TS for the backend or frontend. I have used TS with React, Angular, and Nest.js.

I also have C# experience (.NET Core) with the ASP.NET framework.
